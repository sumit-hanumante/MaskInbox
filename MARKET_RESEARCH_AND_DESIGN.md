# Market Research and Design Plan for MaskInbox

## Product Need and Demand
- Temporary email services let users avoid spam and protect privacy when signing up for services.
- Established competitors such as Temp-Mail, 10MinuteMail, and Guerrilla Mail receive millions of visits monthly, showing sustained demand.
- Search trends historically show consistent interest in keywords like "temp mail" and "temporary email," indicating ongoing user need.

## Target Markets
- High internet usage and privacy awareness make regions like India, the United States, Indonesia, Brazil, and Russia strong targets.
- Users typically include privacy-conscious individuals, developers testing sign-up flows, and people avoiding promotional emails.

## Monetization Potential
- **Freemium model:** free basic inboxes, with paid plans for custom domains, longer retention, or multiple addresses.
- **Advertising:** unobtrusive ads or affiliate links in the inbox interface.
- **Developer API:** subscription access for automated testing or bulk inbox creation.

## Marketing Strategy
- Focus on SEO for terms such as "temporary email" and "disposable inbox."
- Publish blog posts on privacy, spam prevention, and best practices to drive organic traffic.
- Launch on communities like Product Hunt and relevant privacy forums to reach early adopters.
- Provide open-source client libraries or browser extensions to encourage sharing.

## Design Guidelines
- Minimal, responsive layout centered around the generated email address and inbox.
- Clear call-to-action buttons for copying the address, refreshing the inbox, and deleting messages.
- Display inbox messages in a simple list with subject, sender, and time.
- Offer dark and light modes with neutral backgrounds and a single accent color for interactive elements.
- Include visible privacy policy and data deletion controls to build trust.

## Technical Considerations
- Serverless architecture or managed services (e.g., Supabase) for scaling and storage.
- Automatic message expiration to limit storage costs and improve privacy.
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention to protect infrastructure.
